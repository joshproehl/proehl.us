# Proehl.us

This repository contains the static site generator used to create the http://proehl.us homepage.

It uses [Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws) to generate the output HTML, but it's not a particularly interesting or complex example of a nanoc site.
It also uses [D3](http://d3js.org) to do the family tree, but it's only a minorly interesting example of D3.

In short, not much of interest. :-)
